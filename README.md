This app was originally a 72 hour hack-a-thon project built with React utilizing both Yelp and Google Maps API's.  MLB Tailgates allows users to select which baseball stadium they wish to visit, then it will return the top 10 sports bars according to Yelp which are located within 2000 meters of the stadium, with a visual of where they are located relative to the stadium on Google Maps.  In order to complete the application, I created my own API for stadium information and created a proxy server to act as middleware for custom routes.  Future updates to this application will include custom searches of activites beyond sports bars and converting the app to Redux.
